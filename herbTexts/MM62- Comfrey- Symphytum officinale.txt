Clinical Actions: vulnerary, demulcent, emollient, antioxidant, nutritive, anti-inflammatory, astringent; affinity for akin, mucous membranes, connective tissue 
Primary Uses: called “knitbone” and “consound” because of its reputation in helping to heal broken bones; helps heal damaged skin, muscles, ligaments, tendons, and mucous membranes, likely due to its high content of silicic acid and allantoin; silicic acid is water-soluble and highly assimilable and may provide the silicon co-factor necessary for the manufacturing of new collagen fibers in connective tissue healing; rich content of flavonoids, carotenoids, and chlorophyll in leaves contributes to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, which contribute to the vulnerary properties; rich in cooling, soothing mucilage which helps in swelling, bruising, and pain of sprains, strains, and blunt trauma 
Constituents: silicic acid, allantoin, mucilaginous polysaccharides, tannins, pyrrolizidine alkaloids
Cautions/Contraindications/Possible Adverse effects: Contains pyrrolozidine alkaloids (PAs), which in high or prolonged use can be seriously toxic to the liver, causing vino-occlusive disease—while this effect is rare, the mechanism has been scientifically established; only a few recorded cases of serious liver damage or death due to extreme/prolonged doses of comfrey, but this effect has been observed with other PA-containing plants; PA toxicity is cumulative and may not be apparent until more advanced stages are present; highest concentration of PAs are found in roots and young shoots, and mature leaves have the lowest concentration; therapeutic doses should not be taken for more than 10 days-2 weeks; pregnant women, nursing women, young children, elderly, and those with liver disease should avoid PAs; banned by the FDA for internal use, but legal for external use
