Tincture- 1:2-1:5, 50%, 30-60 drops up to 3x/day
Decoction- 1:30, 2-3 oz. 2-3x/day (water extractions are generally more nauseant than tincture form)

Vitalist Actions and Energetics: cool/cold, dry, tonic/astringent, bitter, vital stimulant
Clinical Actions: moderate hepatic stimulant, mild/moderate laxative, alterative (focusing on liver and bowel), cholagogue, digestive bitter, aperient, astringent; affinity for GI, mucous membranes, skin, liver, blood (intercellular fluid)
Primary Uses: May be helpful for chronic skin conditions if root cause is impacted by bowel toxemia or liver stagnancy; combines well with other herbs (i.e. Mahonia, Arctium) for chronic skin conditions; contains low levels of anthraquinone glycosides, which diminish when dried; traditionally used as an iron tonic (in formula with Taraxacum, Arctium, and nettles), especially in a syrup of molasses—current understanding is that this preparation aids in the uptake of iron from other sources, as there is only poorly absorbable plant-sourced iron in this formula, and therefore this formula should not be used by itself to treat iron deficient states (such as anemia); can help with constipation associated with impaired bile flow
Constituents: anthraquinone glycosides, tannins, oxalates, sugars, mucilaginous polysaccharides, starch, minerals, fatty acids
Cautions/Contraindications/Possible Adverse effects: strong cholagogue, so contraindicated with diagnosed gallstones, as it may moves tone and cause obstruction of duct; can cause nausea and digestive upset in high doses with some individuals; as with any laxative, should not be used in cases of obstructive bowel disease; should not be used with people with known oxalate kidney stones; use caution with those taking medications primarily metabolized in the liver
