Oat Straw: mineral content helps supports healthy bones, teeth, hair, and nails; supportive nutritive for women during pregnancy and lactation; provides readily available alkaline minerals that are easily depleted from the body due to the consumption of coffee and/or acidic foods; well-indicated in individuals who are malnourished; indicated for high cholesterol; good for inflammation of the GI tract
Cautions/Contraindications/Possible Adverse Effects: generally safe and food-like; contraindicated for those who may have celiac or gluten sensitivities, but it is possible to find certified GF oat straw.
