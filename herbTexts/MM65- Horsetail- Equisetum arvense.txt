Horsetail- Equisetum arvense
Family: Equisetaceae
Common Names: shave grass, scouring rush, pipes, running club moss, shavetail grass, pewterwort, bottlebrush, devil’s guts, joint grass, toad pipes
Parts used: aerial parts
Forms and Dosages: 
Infusion (warm or overnight)- 1:30, 2-4 oz. 1-3x/day
Powder- not recommended
Tincture- not very useful except as a moderate mucous membrane astringent and diuretic
Vitalist Actions and Energetics: cold and dry, strong stimulant, tonic/astringent; affinity for connective tissue and the urinary system
Clinical Actions: nutritive, diuretic, astringent, hemostatic, styptic, vulnerary; affinity for the kidney and urinary tract, gut
Primary Uses: used for connective tissue healing, as it contains a high concentration of silicic acid (twice as much as in Symphytum—these two plants have more silicic acid than any other known herb except Agrimony seeds); generally, best used in formula, at about 5% of the composition to avoid over-drying and irritation to the kidneys
Constituents: silicic acid, minerals, flavonoids, phenolic acids, polyacetylenes, phytosterols, alkaloids
Cautions/Contraindications/Possible Adverse effects: best to take as an infusion for shorter periods (<10 days); can be overly drying and/or irritating, especially to the kidneys; should be avoided in active kidney infection or inflammatory conditions; one study found that as little as 3 grams of Horsetail boiled in a liter of water for a few hours yielded enough dissolved silicon to exceed the recommended daily allowance
